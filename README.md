## Scope of the proposed area:
   
   According to the Champaign County Criminal Justice System Assessment [citation here], reentry is one of the most prioritized programs and a crucial step in reducing recidivism. The report states that newly-released offenders are inadequately prepared for their return to the community and “the only resource established to assist them is an overworked parole agent who lacks the time and training necessary to connect offenders with supportive services to aid in successful reentry” [citation here]. The benefits of having a comprehensive and effective reentry program extend to all factors involved in the criminal justice system, not only reducing jail crowding as well as law enforcement costs, but also enhancing efficient public safety. Reentry program requires intensive plans and works through collaborative efforts between multiple groups, including criminal justice and social services agencies and various community-based organizations. It contains a lot of components from education and skills training, employments seeking, to family planning and parenting [citation here]. 
	
   One of the most important parts of the reentry program is to help offenders looking for jobs after being released from the jail. Research has shown a clear link between crime and work [citation here]. Having a legitimate job lessens the chances of re-offending following release from prison. Also, the higher the wages, the less likely it is that returning prisoners will return to crime. Although most prisoners held a job before their incarceration, they confront many barriers to employment such as low education levels, stigma, and lost time in the labor force, upon their return to the community. Thus, it is important to explore the role these factors play in the reintegration process. Inspire by this issue, I am particularly interested in exploring how to improve the ex-offender employment opportunities reference system, which would be beneficial not only for offenders who are in needs of information and supports to reintegrate into the society after being released; but also for society by greatly enhancing public safety, preserving families, and strengthening social networks and support systems. Towards that objective, I want to propose an ontological approach in order to improve ex-offender employment case management that not only integrate information about ex-offender employments available from different sources, but also identify a standard process how this reference system should work and who are the parties could be involved.
	
   To support ex-offender reintegration into society, some states have adopted policies encourage employment opportunities for eligible applicants. At least 27 states limit or prohibit the use of criminal records in public or private employment and for licensing eligibility [citation here]. In Illinois state, there are several programming and resources targeted to providing services to individuals with a criminal background who have served their sentence and need a second chance such as: City of Chicago Hiring Guidelines [citation here] which is produced by Chicago Department of Human Resource for reviewing criminal convictions in order to make sure that ex-offenders are referred to occupy positions that are suitable and appropriate and do not place undue risk to the City. There are several parameters taken from the guidelines when it comes to consider employments for ex-offenders: “nature of convictions” (e.g. if the conviction is job-related then state laws allows denial of employment); “evidence of rehabilitation” (e.g. establishing proof of rehabilitation allows an ex-offender to have occupational disqualifications lifted), number of convictions, length of time has passed, age of the candidate by the time of conviction, etc. Customized Work Service Program which is created and supported by Department of Family & Support Services Programs. The program provides information about “transitional jobs” [citation here] which are combinations of training, skill development, supportive services and real work activities. Participants would be trained into certain job categorizations (e.g. ground maintenance, snow removal, small engine repairs). 
	

## Relationships to the case study:

   As mentioned above, the goal of this study is to propose an ontology approach to integrate available information from different sources that could support ex-offenders getting suitable jobs after being in jail. I also want to identify who are the organizations (some of them are mentioned in the above session) interested in and currently being involved in this employment reference process and propose a standard process show these organizations should collaborate to each other. There is several information from our dataset are relevant such as: occupation information of the offenders could be used to categorize and prioritize what kinds of jobs are most suitable for offenders after being released. Education information is also helpful in order to identify which job level is applicable for individual offenders. Other demographic information such as: age also could be used. The jail remaining time is also a factor to consider.
