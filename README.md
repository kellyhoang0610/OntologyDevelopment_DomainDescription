##1. Scope of the proposed area:
According to the Champaign county criminal justice system institute for law and policy planning [citation here], reentry is one of the most prioritized programs and a crucial step in reducing recidivism. Their report confirms that newly-released offenders are inadequately prepared for their return to the community, where the only resource established to assist them is an overworked parole agent who lacks the time and training necessary to connect offenders with supportive services to aid in successful reentry. The benefits of having a comprehensive and effective reentry program extend to all factors involved in the criminal justice system, not only reducing jail crowding as well as law enforcement costs, but also enhancing efficient public safety. Reentry program requires intensive plans and works through collaborative efforts between multiple groups, including criminal justice and social services agencies and various community-based organizations. 

One of the aspects of the reentry program that I am particularly interested in is how to improve the ex-offender employment opportunities management system, which would be beneficial not only for offenders who are in needs of information and supports to reintegrate into the society after being released; but also for society by greatly enhancing public safety, preserving families, and strengthening social networks and support systems. Inspired by this idea, in this project, I want to propose an ontological approach in order to improve ex-offender employment case management. 

##2. Relationships to the case study:
There are several data from the CSV file provided that could be used in the employment management system: occupation information of the offenders: use to categorize and prioritize what kinds of jobs are most suitable for offenders after being released. Education information is also helpful in order to identify which job level is applicable for individual offenders. Other demographic information such as: age also could be used. The jail remaining time is also a factor to consider.
